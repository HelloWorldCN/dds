After downloading these videos, we get 7 traffic camera videos and 9 dash camera videos.

#### 1.1.2 Drone videos

We obtain drone videos through a public dataset called [VisDrone](https://www.aiskyeye.com). We only use 13 videos in this dataset (there are too many videos inside...).

#### 1.1.3 Face videos

We use clips from TBBT and Friends.

## 2. Install Instructions

To run our code, please make sure that conda is installed. First, run

```git checkout clean```

to enter in the clean branch of DDS. And then under the DDS repo, run

```conda env create -f conda_environment_configuration.yml```

to install dds environment. Note that this installation assumes that you have GPU resources on your machine. If not, please temporarily skip this step.

## 3. Run our code

Run

```cd workspace```

to cd into the workspace of DDS. Inside that folder, we have a configuration file ```configuration.yml``` that allows you to customize the behavior of DDS and conduct parameter sweeping on DDS easily (we put some comments there to help you understand each configuration). Then, run

```python entrance.py```

to run DDS! Note that the configuration file will be only load **once** in the above line. So you can change the configuration file freely after running the program without changing the behavior of the program.
